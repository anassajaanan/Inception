## **Overview**

This project represents a comprehensive endeavor to create a robust, secure, and high-performance web infrastructure using Docker. By dockerizing a suite of essential services, each within its own container built from scratch, the project showcases an advanced level of container orchestration and system architecture design. Alpine Linux, known for its security, performance, and minimal footprint, serves as the base image for all containers, ensuring the infrastructure is lightweight yet capable.

### **Key Components of the Infrastructure**

- **Nginx**: Serves as the reverse proxy and entry point to the infrastructure, handling secure HTTPS connections and directing traffic efficiently.
- **WordPress with PHP-FPM**: Powers dynamic content delivery, configured for optimal performance without the overhead of Nginx.
- **MariaDB**: Provides the relational database services for WordPress, emphasizing reliability and performance.
- **Redis**: Implements server-side caching for WordPress, significantly enhancing website speed and efficiency.
- **FTP Server**: Offers a direct, managed file transfer service, simplifying content updates and maintenance for the WordPress site.
- **Adminer**: Facilitates database management through a web interface, simplifying database tasks.
- **Static Site**: A simple, yet impactful, static website showcasing features of our web server implementation, demonstrating the infrastructure's versatility.
- **Todo List Application**: A full-stack application featuring a MongoDB database, illustrating the project's capacity to support diverse applications and services.

### **Project Goals**

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. **Demonstrate Proficiency in Docker**: Through the dockerization of multiple services from scratch, highlighting the ability to configure, manage, and orchestrate complex, multi-container environments.
2. **Ensure Security and Performance**: By utilizing Alpine Linux as the base image and implementing best practices in container setup and network configuration.
3. **Showcase Scalability and Flexibility**: Through the integration of various services into a cohesive system, designed to be easily expandable and adaptable to new requirements.

### **Implementation Highlights**

- Custom-built Docker images for all services, avoiding the use of pre-built images to ensure control over the environment and configurations.
- Strategic use of Docker volumes for persistent storage, ensuring data durability across container restarts and deployments.
- Utilization of Docker networks for secure and efficient communication between containers, facilitating a modular yet integrated system architecture.
- Deployment and orchestration with Docker Compose, enabling straightforward management of the entire infrastructure through a single declarative configuration file.

This project not only serves as a testament to the practical applications of Docker in building modern web infrastructures but also as a blueprint for designing and implementing a scalable, secure, and high-performance containerized environment.
